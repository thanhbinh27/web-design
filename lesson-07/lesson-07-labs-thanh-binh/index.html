            <h3>Children's Lessons</h3>
            <p>Chidlren;s full-day lessons meet from 10 am through 3:30 pm, One of the most important tasks of
                anyone in
                charge of children’s ministry is that of deciding what truth to teach the children under your care.
                In
                my years as
                a children’s ministry director it was one task that I took very seriously. There were so many things
                I
                wanted the children in our church to know, but as I listed them out, they all boiled down to the
                gospel:
                who is God?, who is man? and what did Jesus do?
                With these three simple questions and spiritual guidelines in mind I started forming our children’s
                materials.</p>
