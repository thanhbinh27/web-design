                <h3>Children's Lessons</h3>
                <p>Chidlren;s full-day lessons meet from 10 am through 3:30 pm, One of the most important tasks of
                    anyone in
                    charge of children’s ministry is that of deciding what truth to teach the children under your care.
                    In
                    my years as
                    a children’s ministry director it was one task that I took very seriously. There were so many things
                    I
                    wanted the children in our church to know, but as I listed them out, they all boiled down to the
                    gospel:
                    who is God?, who is man? and what did Jesus do?
                    With these three simple questions and spiritual guidelines in mind I started forming our children’s
                    materials.</p>

                <p>God deserves praise! That’s why the book of book of Psalms is a wonderful example of spiritual
                    worship. This 32 lesson curriculum will help children understand and experience the character of God
                    and respond with praise.</p>
